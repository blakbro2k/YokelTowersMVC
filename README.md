# YokelTowersMVC
Working on a clone for Yahoo Towers. Most update and uses Libgdx Autum for the UI

# Introduction
Greetings! Welcome to my Github.  This has been a pet project of my for at the better part of
5 years now.  In 1999, Yahoo.com created a fun hub of my childhood known as Yahoo! Games.
While they outsourced a lot of the games, this was one of their few in house products.
Now that Yahoo! Games is shutdown, this was removed with it.  I am trying to recreate it.

### News & Community
What has been done so far.

I have all but completed the server launcher for this game which I built from scratch.
It has all the rooms, games and tables that report back to the client.

I am now working on the UI from scratch and finalizing the game logic.

The next last major piece is a gamemanager that can run the games on the server side

### Getting Started

The game is not playable yet as work through the UI.  If you wish to look at what I have done you may copy the git to your ide.
I use Android Studio and Gradle so it would be much easier if you use that.

To launch the main class, there is a DesktopLauncher class that will kick everything off.

### Contributing
Right now I am pretty much working solo.  I could use some reviewers if anyone has a better way of doing any of what I have done.
